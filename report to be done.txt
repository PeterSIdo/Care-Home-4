1. enter resident_initilas
2. enter unit_name generated from care1.db / residents
(this snippet can re-use routes /select_unit, /select_resident

3. promt user to enter service from service_list
4. report_logic (similiar to data_collecton_logic):
if service_name == fluid_intake then render report_slected_data.html
